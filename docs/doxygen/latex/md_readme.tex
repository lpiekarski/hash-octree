Hash\+Octree structure acts just like a normal octree structure but also saves a lot of memory by recognizing which sub-\/octrees are the same and holding them in a single sub-\/octree instance. Worst case scenario if every sub-\/octree is different it takes the same amount of memory as classic octree structure implemented in a 64-\/bit system.

\item {\ttfamily Use}\#include \char`\"{}\{\+D\+I\+R\}/hash-\/octree/include/hashoctree.\+h\char`\"{}{\ttfamily in your code, where}\{D\+IR\}{\ttfamily is path to directory in which you called}git clone\`{}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\section*{Usage}

If you are looking for a guide on how to use this library check out the wiki pages. Most common use case is to create a Hash\+Octree instance, insert some data into it using {\ttfamily Hash\+Octree\+::add\+Data\+Shape} and {\ttfamily Hash\+Octree\+::add\+Data\+Point} and then mutate contained data or test it for collision against some other objects.

\section*{How does it work}

Hash\+Octree structure contains a root sub-\/octree reference and a dictionary consisting of $\ast$(parent key -\/$>$ children keys)$\ast$ bindings. Keys are generated by a specific hashing function satisfying the following\+: keys of 2 different sub-\/octrees which have the same children\textquotesingle{} keys and store the same data are equal.
